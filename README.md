# SVM-Kernel
Kernel Function is a method used to take data as input and transform it into the required form of processing data. “Kernel” is used due to a set of mathematical functions used in Support Vector Machine providing the window to manipulate the data. So, Kernel Function generally transforms the training set of data so that a non-linear decision surface is able to transform to a linear equation in a higher number of dimension spaces. Basically, It returns the inner product between two points in a standard feature dimension.
